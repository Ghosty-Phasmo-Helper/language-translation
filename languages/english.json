As the site activity monitor is an approximate representation of the total EMF currently present in the map, seeing multiple jumps of 4 and 5 levels is a likely indication of EMF 5, especially if no players are currently inside the investigation area. Note that a Poltergeist multi-throw may also show a jump of 5 or more; either way, using an EMF reader is a more reliable way of verifying EMF 5 as a piece of evidence. An increase or decrease of 3 or 4 levels may also represent EMF level 5, but should not be used as an indicator for EMF 5, as these levels are more likely to represent an EMF 3 interaction, a ghost event, and/or multiple stacked interactions done in quick succession.",
